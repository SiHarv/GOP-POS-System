# Backend Separation Summary

## Files Modified

### 1. `controller/backend_receipt_print.php` (NEW/MOVED)
**Purpose**: Handles all receipt printing and finalization functionality

**Moved Functions:**
- `getReceiptDetails($id)` - Enhanced with finalized status tracking
- `finalizeReceipt($receiptId)` - Handles stock subtraction and receipt finalization
- `getItemStock($itemId)` - Private helper for stock checking

**AJAX Handlers:**
- `get_receipt_details` - Returns detailed receipt information for printing
- `finalize_receipt` - Finalizes receipt and subtracts stock

### 2. `controller/backend_receipts.php` (MODIFIED)
**Purpose**: Handles receipt listing, searching, and basic operations

**Kept Functions:**
- `getAllReceipts()` - Receipt listing with pagination
- `getTotalReceiptsCount()` - Count for pagination
- `getReceiptDetails()` - Now delegates to ReceiptPrintController

**Removed Functions:**
- `finalizeReceipt()` - Moved to backend_receipt_print.php
- `getItemStock()` - Moved to backend_receipt_print.php

**AJAX Handlers:**
- `get_details` - Basic receipt details (delegates to print controller)
- `search_receipts` - Search and pagination functionality

### 3. `js/receipt_print.js` (MODIFIED)
**Updated to use:** `backend_receipt_print.php` instead of `backend_receipts.php` for finalization

## Benefits of Separation

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each controller has a clear, focused purpose
2. **Better Maintainability**: Print logic is isolated from listing logic
3. **Enhanced Security**: Stock modification is in a dedicated controller
4. **Cleaner Code**: Related functionality is grouped together
5. **Future Extensibility**: Easy to add print-specific features

## API Endpoints

### Receipt Listing (backend_receipts.php)
- `get_details` - Get basic receipt info
- `search_receipts` - Search and paginate receipts

### Receipt Printing (backend_receipt_print.php)
- `get_receipt_details` - Get detailed receipt for printing
- `finalize_receipt` - Finalize receipt and subtract stock

## File Structure
```
controller/
├── backend_receipts.php      (Receipt listing & search)
├── backend_receipt_print.php (Printing & finalization)
└── backend_charge.php        (Charge creation)
```

This separation creates a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with clear boundaries between different functionalities.
